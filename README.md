A universal, minimalistic, and beautiful service uptime monitor.

## About

This entire project (backend in Python/Sanic + aiohttp + MySQL, and a responsive frontend in HTML/CSS/JS with Chart.js) was **completely generated by Gemini 3.1 Pro** in just half an hour!

It features a high-contrast dark theme, zero-border aesthetics, and real-time interactive charts for ping and historical status monitoring.

**Live Demo:** [https://mriyaup.yaklovn.xyz/](https://mriyaup.yaklovn.xyz/)

## Setup

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in your details:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Edit the `.env` file to add the comma-separated URLs you want to monitor:
   ```env
   URLS=https://google.com,https://github.com
   ```
3. Run the application using Docker Compose:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d --build
   ```
   *The initial startup might take a few seconds as the database initializes.*

4. Access the beautiful dark-themed dashboard at `http://localhost:8000`
